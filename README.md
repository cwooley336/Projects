# 1) ðŸš— Raleigh Car Crashes: Data Science & Analytics Project

This project explores patterns and predictors of car crashes in Raleigh, North Carolina using real-world crash data from 2015â€“2024. It combines rigorous data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning forecasting to uncover insights and predict future crash trends.

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

- ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  - Parsed and resampled crash records using `pandas`  
  - Engineered time-based features (month, weekday, lag variables)  
  - Handled missing values and ensured reproducibility

- ðŸ“ˆ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Visualized crash trends over time  
  - Identified seasonal patterns and post-COVID shifts  
  - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for clear, publication-ready plots

- ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning Forecasting**  
  - Built predictive models using `XGBoost` and `SARIMA`  
  - Compared statistical vs ML approaches for time-series forecasting  
  - Forecasted monthly crash counts for 2025

- ðŸ§  **Model Evaluation & Interpretation**  
  - Tuned hyperparameters and validated model performance  
  - Visualized predictions with confidence and clarity  
  - Documented tradeoffs between interpretability and complexity
