# Raleigh Car Crashes: Data Science & Analytics Project

This project analyzes car crash data from Raleigh, North Carolina (2015â€“2024) to uncover patterns, forecast future crash trends, and predict fatal outcomes. It combines exploratory analysis, time-series forecasting, and classification modeling to support public safety. Additionally, an interactive Power BI dashboard is included for a more focused analysis of raleigh car crash dynamics. View the full dashboard [here]([Raleigh Crashes Dashboard.pdf](https://github.com/cwooley336/Projects/blob/35559e0bd0239052a506901c96fcb5c6db25dfca/raleigh-crashes/Raleigh%20Crashes%20Dashboard.pdf)).

## Project Description

- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
  - Cleaned and manipulated crash records using `pandas`
  - Prepared data for Power BI interactive dashboard
  - Engineered temporal features (hour, weekday, month)
  - Encoded categorical variables and handled missing data

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Visualized crash frequency by time, location, and zone
  - Identified seasonal patterns and high-risk roads
  - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plots

- **Time-Series Forecasting**
  - Forecasted monthly crash counts for 2025 using:
    - `XGBoost` (feature-based regression)
    - `SARIMA` (statistical seasonal modeling)
  - Compared model outputs and visualized predictions

- **Fatality Prediction**
  - Built classification models to predict fatal crashes using:
    - `Logistic Regression` with class weighting for class imbalance
    - `Random Forest` with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV` to optimize best parameters (depth, splits, and feature selection)
  - Evaluated performance using precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and PR curves
  - Extracted feature importances to guide future data collection
